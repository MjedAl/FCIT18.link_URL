# Link manager

My main goal with this project is to easly add subdomains redirection to the link  
before i had to login every time to the origrinal DNS provider and add it there. And only one person can do it.
Now multiple authenticated users can edit on the domain, Add new subdomains, quickly create short links with random id, see the number of clicks.
