# Link manager

My main goal with this project is to have an easier way of adding subdomains redirection to the link, before I had to login every time to the original DNS provider and add it there. And only one person can do it.  
Now multiple authenticated users can edit on the domain, Add new subdomains, quickly create short links with random id, see the number of clicks.

Other than the flask admin page, there's a reporting dashbaord built with Metabase. It can be viewed @ https://fcit18.link/report

Built with Flask :)



- and YES I know there is probably a service out there that does this for you, but where is the fun in that and it will probably be more expensive :)
